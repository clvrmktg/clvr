Your website is not about you—even when it is.  

One of the hardest things to communicate to clients is that their “vision” has to be shaped by best practice.  

Most people know they *need* a website. They understand it should help people find their business online. But once the process begins—especially for DIYers—websites often become more about self-expression than effectiveness. Content takes a backseat to “that looks pretty.”  

But here’s the truth: **your website isn’t art. It’s design.** And that difference matters.

## Art vs. Design  

Art is subjective. Everyone has their own interpretation of what’s beautiful.  

Design is different. Good design has a purpose. It uses structure, content, and visuals to communicate clearly:  

- **Who you are.**  
- **What you do.**  
- **What the visitor should do next.**  

If visitors can’t answer those three questions within seconds, your website has failed—no matter how “pretty” it looks.

## Think of It Like a Store  

Imagine walking into a store where everything is beautifully displayed but nothing is labeled. You can’t find prices, staff, or even the checkout counter.  

That store might look amazing, but would you buy anything? Probably not.  

Your website works the same way. A beautiful layout that hides the important details—or buries the call to action—will leave visitors frustrated and gone before you know it.

## Form Follows Function  

The type of business you run should dictate how your site is designed.  

- A restaurant website needs clear menus, opening hours, and booking options.  
- A construction company website should highlight credibility, past projects, and an easy way to request a quote.  
- An e-commerce store must make finding and buying products effortless.  

Every detail should be framed around your customer’s needs—not your personal preferences.

## Final Thoughts — It’s About Them, Not You  

Websites that convert aren’t about pleasing the business owner’s eye. They’re about making life easier for the customer.  

Pretty matters—but **clarity, usability, and results matter more.**  

At Clever, we build websites that combine design with strategy, so your visitors don’t just admire your site—they act.
