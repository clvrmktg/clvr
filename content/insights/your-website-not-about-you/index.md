Your website is not about you—even when it is.

One of the hardest things communicating to clients is the need to curtail their "vision" in line with best practice.

Most people don't really understand how websites work. For the most part, they understand: "[I need a website](/insights/do-i-still-need-website-2025)", they understand it's supposed to at least help people find them or their business online, but in the process of putting them together (especially, the DIYer), they think of it more as art than design. Content takes a backseat to: "that's pretty".

You might ask: "Aren't websites supposed to be pretty?" Sure, but there's a big difference between pretty and functional, between art and design, between a dud and what converts visitors into customers.

And that's just who your website is for—your visitors.

# Art and Design

More often than not, most people want the prettiest, most animated, "make the logo bigger" website they can have. They want the flash.

Pretty is great, but it's also subject to interpretation. That's what art is—subject to interpretation. It's abstract and everybody can walk away with their own opinions as to what it may mean. 

And while everyone can have an opinion on how your website looks, there should be no confusion about who you are, what you do and what your visitors are supposed to do. 

Enter design.

Design uses processes, images and symbols to convey a clear message.


# Think of It Like a Store

Quick access versus not being able to find anything.

# Frame

Type of business determines type of customers.
