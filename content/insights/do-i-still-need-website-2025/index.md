It's crazy that this is even a question, but it's a popular search, hence why I'm writing this article and you're here.

The short answer. Yes.

Picture this, you just met someone. Whether you had a great or unpleasant conversation with them, if you're curious about them for whatever reason, where's the first place you look?

Social media. 

We have this thing where we want to know. Believe it or not, it's the same when people introduce their businesses to us. The only difference is, instead, we turn to Google.

And believe it or not, when you don't find one, you make an assumption. Not a very good one I might add.

In this article, we'll go over some practical reasons why you still need a website in 2025.

# Credibility

If you have a business, you can put a lot of effort into any number of things, but being online should be near the top of the list.

That gutteral reaction that you have when you look online for a business and don't find their website... well, that's how others feel when they search your business and find nothing there.

A website for some reason or other, validates your business and says that you're serious about it.

# Trust

So, someone's found your website, this creates another opportunity for your business to build trust with potential customers.

While just being online gives you legitimacy, a functional, well designed website acts as a signal to your potential customer how seriously they should take your business.

A poorly designed website can erode that initial credibility. A design where your potential customer can't find what they need right away, well they leave just as fast as they came.
