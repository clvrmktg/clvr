## The Challenge
As a **brand-new company** in a competitive industry, Clear Choice Glass needed more than just a website — they needed a **credible, professional online presence** to attract customers and compete against established players.  

They had:
- A logo, business cards, and flyers already designed  
- No existing website or online footprint

We started by analyzing their logo, business cards, and flyers to extract colors, typography, and visual patterns. This ensured the new site stayed consistent with their offline identity while elevating it for the web.  

### 2. Strategic SEO Planning

- *Bahamas web design* (for our portfolio positioning)
- *Hurricane windows Bahamas*
- *Impact doors Nassau*
- *Custom glass Bahamas*
- *Window and door installation Bahamas*  

These keywords informed page structures, meta descriptions, and on-page content from day one — giving Clear Choice an SEO head start.  

### 3. Technical & Stylistic Execution
We built a **fast, responsive, and mobile-friendly website** using modern web technologies. The design showcased:
- High-quality imagery of products and installations  
- Clear navigation to services like *Hurricane Windows & Doors*, *Shower Glass Enclosures*, and *Storefront Frames*  
- Prominent calls-to-action, including *Request a Quote* forms on key pages  

### 4. Lead Generation & Trust Building
