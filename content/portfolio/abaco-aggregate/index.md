Abaco Aggregate & Cement, Ltd. (Abaco Aggregate) is a trusted supplier of aggregate and cement solutions in The Bahamas. Their commitment to quality has made them a key player in construction projects across the islands.

### Initial Project: A One-Page Website

When Abaco Aggregate first approached Clever, their goal was to establish an online presence with a simple, one-page design. This initial site effectively introduced the company, outlined its services, and served as a point of contact for potential clients.

### New Challenges with Growth

As Abaco Aggregate’s business expanded, they found that their one-page site no longer met their needs. They wanted to:

- **Showcase Their Work**: Highlight completed projects with client names and detailed photo galleries.
- **Provide More Information**: Include detailed descriptions of their services, product offerings, and project capabilities.
- **Reflect Business Growth**: Establish a professional, multi-page website that matched their expanding role in the industry.

### Clever’s Collaborative Solution

We worked closely with the team at Abaco Aggregate to design and build a robust, multi-page website that grows with their business. Together, we developed a strategy to:

1. **Showcase Projects**: Created dedicated pages for project photo galleries, allowing them to highlight their work visually while providing details about their contributions to each project.
2. **Expand Content**: Built additional pages to outline services, products, and company history, giving visitors a comprehensive understanding of their offerings.
3. **Modernize Design**: Delivered a clean, professional look that reflects their industry leadership and enhances their brand.
Streamline Maintenance: Included ongoing website maintenance through Clever, ensuring that their site stays updated, secure, and optimized for performance.

### The Outcome

The new website successfully:

- Provides an engaging and professional online presence that matches their industry growth.
- Makes it easy for prospective clients to explore their projects and better understand their capabilities.
- Ensures the site remains a valuable business tool through continuous updates and maintenance.

### Looking Ahead

Abaco Aggregate’s partnership with Clever demonstrates the value of evolving alongside a growing business. As their needs change, their website can continue to scale and adapt, ensuring they remain at the forefront of their industry.
